<h1>Add an one way sync from ticktick and github to google calendar</h1>

> What if you could track your overall progress effortless in google calendar?

## Why

We as developers often experience a sense of working all the time and still feeling like we are not accomplishing enough.

## Solution

To combat this feeling I decided to track my progress from both ticktick and also github, the platforms I use the most.

So I developed a npm package, called <a href="https://github.com/lucasvtiradentes/gcal-sync#readme">gcal-sync</a>, which basically adds a one way sync between ticktick and github to google calendar.
